An update for tp5 project progress

On Thursday, September 29th  I created this document to track my progress on Tiny Project 5.
On Sunday, October 2nd I viewed the "tp5" video on Panopto, after viewing the other introductory videos for JavaScript. The efforts I have made throughout the day consist of the following: 
 - Tweaking CSS and HTML to fit the JavaScript code given throughout the instructional video
 - Implementing and tweaking the JavaScript code given throughout the instructional video 
 - Fixing errors in my code (which were due to standard errors and grammar errors) 
 - Learning more about the Intricacies of JavaScript and Functions
